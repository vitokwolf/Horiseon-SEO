# Code Refactor Starter Code
## [Welcome to Horiseon](https://vitokwolf.github.io/Horiseon-SEO/).
## On this website we provide brief information about our services.

_What changes I have made:_
*Updated the html code, changed generic div to more specific tags like header, footer, etc
*Updated some missing key links for proper page navigation.
*Updated description for images to facilitate assistant navigation.
*Replaced multiple classes with just one that uses same properties.

*Updated the css code by merging same properties for same classes, thus eliminating the need to repeat the code.
*Updated the selectors to follow a more easy to follow semantic structure.
