# Code Refactor Starter Code
## [Welcome to Horiseon](https://vitokwolf.github.io/Horiseon-SEO/).
## On this website we provide brief information about our services.

### What changes I have made:
_HTML Changes_
* Updated the html code, changed generic div to more specific tags like header, footer, etc
* Updated some missing key links for proper page navigation.
* Updated description for images to facilitate assistant navigation.
* Replaced multiple classes with just one that uses same properties.

_Css changes:_
* Updated the css code by merging same properties for same classes, thus eliminating the need to repeat the code.
* Updated the selectors to follow a more easy to follow semantic structure.
